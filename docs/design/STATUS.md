# Status

Updated 2026-10-24. How far smith's code is from its design, and the
work that takes it there. Owners keep the rows their work changes
(skein's owners.md, 4.4).

## 1. Plans

Local older-store refusal is in implementation review: generated local-store
family 1, checked-root admission before recovery, named operator refusal and
trace admission (protocol/hosts.md 5.3; domain/host.md 8; shell.md 4.1, 4.3,
5.3). Independent QA, owner gate and landing remain required.

| Plan | State | Takes the design to | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| jig's test-budgets | done 2026-10-14 | no section of smith's design: smith's focused suite back within its 30 s budget (15 s budget before the user's doubling of 10-22, provisional) on carbon-forge (`docs/development/workflow.md`, 2; skein's `testing-strategy.md`, 8), and skein's read of what has arrived in smith's readers of unframed bytes (skein's `lib.md`, 7) | jig's `docs/development/plans/test-budgets/` |
| jig's jig-protocol | done 2026-10-13 | no section of smith's design: smith takes skein's in-process addresses, `io::Limits::names` and the kernel's opens (its smith 01, and a closing repin) | jig's `docs/development/plans/jig-protocol/` |
| Domain completion | done 2026-10-07 | `domain/`: the run, session and tools domains conformed; the local host's domain, with transcripts, resuming, delivery in place and recovery of answered calls | `~/src/rust/plans/domain-completion-plan/ (not versioned)` |
| Protocol layer | done 2026-10-08 | `protocol/` as first designed: the codecs, both halves of the channel, the LLM and machine components, the agent process, spawning hosts, the local host's protocol layer | `~/src/rust/plans/smith-protocol-layer/ (not versioned)` |
| Testing, first pass | done 2026-10-08 | `testing.md`'s tiers: simulated worlds on skein's harness, the real loop, the binary end to end against fakes, an opt-in live suite | `~/src/rust/plans/smith-testing/ (not versioned)` |
| reliability | done 2026-10-14 | the 2026-10-09 revision of every document, with `shell.md`, `benchmarks.md`, `protocol/events.md` and `protocol/limits.md`: what is left of sessions 00 and 03–12, and session 13, which proves live what its first run (2026-10-09 to 2026-10-12, `~/src/rust/plans/reliability-plan/`, not versioned) landed unproven | `docs/development/plans/reliability/` |
| parity | done 2026-10-15: ended short of parity at `87a8d1e8` on RT (benchmarks.md 16.5) | smith on par with Codex, as `benchmarks.md` section 16 defines it: the benchmark tasks, pins, price basis, summaries and verdict (`benchmarks.md` 3, 5, 6, 8–11, 16); jobs (`domain/tools.md` 3 and 5, `domain/session.md` 5, `domain/run.md` 5.3, 8.1 and 9.1, `domain/host.md` 4, `protocol/llm.md` 3, `protocol/events.md` 3.6, `protocol/limits.md` 2–7, `protocol/agent.md` 2, `protocol/transcript.md` 2 and 4); a compaction asked with `ToolChoice::None`, its summary framed (`domain/session.md` 8.2, `domain/run.md` 3.3); the task role (`shell.md` 5.2 and 6.6, `domain/run.md` 3.1, `protocol/limits.md` 4); a failed start that ends the command (`shell.md` 4.3); the tools' descriptions and the empty path (`protocol/llm.md` 3 and 4, `domain/tools.md` 2); `gpt-6.1-sol` (`shell.md` 6.1); skein's `fake-llm.md` 2.1 | `docs/development/plans/parity/` |
| wall-clock | done 2026-10-17 | smith on par with Codex, RT included (`benchmarks.md` 16): the window's check bounding the next prompt, its appended bytes counted at a measured ratio, and a guard holding each prompt sent within the line, the history's bytes taken from the line, the line's material among the effective limits in event vocabulary version 3 (`domain/session.md` 4, 8.1 and 8.2, `protocol/limits.md` 2.1, 3.2, 3.9, 4 and 9, `protocol/llm.md` 6, `protocol/charter.md` 6, `protocol/events.md` 6), and the `history` probe's condition at the line (`benchmarks.md` 11.1); the task role's batched edits and checks, polls beside other work and ranged reads (`shell.md` 6.6); a failed write stopping the writes after it, in transcript version 5 (`domain/session.md` 5, `protocol/llm.md` 3 and 5, `protocol/transcript.md` 2 and 6); a job's wait giving way to the rest of its response (`domain/session.md` 5, `domain/tools.md` 3 and 5); the task role counted as written in the host part's check (`protocol/limits.md` 4, `shell.md` 6.6); spend priced per response, a response failed unsent at nothing, ten `shell-cwd` attempts, the `parity-change` suite and a change's report and stop, peak memory in summaries (`benchmarks.md` 1, 4.2, 5.4, 8.1, 8.2, 11.5, 14, 16.1, 16.2 and 16.6; `shell.md` 5.2); memory returning when its use ends, and `memory` raised should the worst case pass it (`protocol/limits.md` 5 and 11, `testing.md` 6, `shell.md` 6.3) | `docs/development/plans/wall-clock/` |
| live-text | done 2026-10-19 | a run's live text, in channel version 3: the start's ask, and the main conversation's text up the channel in pieces, best effort, coalesced by the agent's service from the LLM component's deltas, its held bytes bounded and the bytes dropped past them counted; the host's half handing each piece to its owner (`protocol/channel.md` 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8; `protocol/limits.md` 2.3, 2.4 and 3.6; `protocol/llm.md` 6; `domain/host.md` 2 and 3); skein's `fake-llm.md` 2.2 | `docs/development/plans/live-text/` |
| accounts | done 2026-10-20 | the first part of LLM accounts, grants: the MIT licence; channel version 4, charter version 3, transcript version 6 and event vocabulary version 4: a grant's value as a credential with its scheme, an LLM with no account, the notices unauthorized, limited and refused with their fields' bounds, a window carried over between providers, the dialects by name and number, `openai` 3, the withdrawn grant and `codex` dialect accepted (`protocol/channel.md` 4, 5, 6; `protocol/charter.md` 2, 5; `protocol/transcript.md` 3, 4, 6; `protocol/events.md` 3.9, 3.10, 6; `protocol/llm.md` 6, 7; `protocol/limits.md` 2.4; `protocol/agent.md` 4; `protocol/hosts.md` 2; `protocol/README.md` 8; `domain/session.md` 3, 4, 8.2; `domain/run.md` 6; `domain/host.md` 2, 7; `shell.md` 6.2); skein's rows that name it | `docs/development/plans/accounts/` |
| perf (round 1) | active on hetzner2 since 2026-10-20 | the 2026-10-20 revision, from the dogfood's comparison with Codex: a write making its missing directories, and its store's every answer answered (`domain/tools.md` 3, 4 and 7, `protocol/agent.md` 2); a no-op edit a match, a call refused unchanged only when its edits leave the file as loaded (`domain/tools.md` 3, `domain/session.md` 5); a poll's default wait `job_poll` under the ceiling `job_wait` (`domain/tools.md` 5, `protocol/llm.md` 3, `protocol/limits.md` 2.3 and 11, `shell.md` 6.5); `--dir`, several directories (`shell.md` 4), the guides sharing what the charter leaves (`protocol/limits.md` 3.9, `domain/run.md` 3.3); `--ephemeral` off the state directory (`shell.md` 4.2); a failed write abandoning its destination, said on standard error by every shell (`protocol/events.md` 5.2); the task role's plan, edits and finish (`shell.md` 6.6); skein's cut exchange `Unavailable` and gzip on the Codex route, repinned; a plain tree past its snapshot's bounds counted as changed, never refusing a start (`protocol/hosts.md` 5.5, `domain/host.md` 8); a session knowing its 256 files read or written last (`domain/tools.md` 4), the summary within 1,000 words (`domain/run.md` 3.3), the task role's whole-file writes and each check once (`shell.md` 6.6) | `~/src/rust/tmp/owners/smith-perf/ (not versioned)` |
| sources | done 2026-10-21, short of its live runs (section 3) | the first part of LLM accounts, sources: the host domain's grant naming its value's form; Claude Code as a program backend, with its sign-in, command, tools, stream, notices, budget and sessions, and the fake program (`protocol/programs.md` 1-9, `domain/tools.md` 10, `protocol/agent.md` 1 and 4); program sources checked and signed out, accounts by source with `none`, `smith login` and `logout` (`protocol/hosts.md` 2, 5.2-5.6, `shell.md` 4-7); a program's event fields (`protocol/events.md` 3.9, 3.10 and 6) | `~/src/rust/tmp/owners/smith-sources/closing.md (not versioned)` |
| Claude Code, and smith on Anthropic | drafting | `benchmarks.md`, sections 6, 7 and 10: Claude Code as the third agent, smith's probes on Anthropic models. Reworked before it runs, after reliability, for the harness's own login (`benchmarks.md`, section 10), not the user's `~/.claude` | `~/src/rust/plans/reliability-plan/smith/11-claude.md (not versioned)` |

Open run lifecycle (`domain/run.md`, 3.1, 6 and 9.1): explicit mode,
text replies listening without a call, and native text-only final turns are
implemented. Open on a program backend is refused at the entrance; the
adapter's Open launch, output and wind-down are protocol/programs.md,
section 9's question.

## 2. The design

Left names each section's unbuilt part, then the plan of section 1 that
builds it (": <plan>" after its items), or "not planned": section 3
says what each waits for. Where the code does other than the design,
Left says what is missing, then, in parentheses, what the code does
instead.

| Document | Built | Left |
|---|---|---|
| `domain/README.md` | partly | 4: `smith-mcp` and supervised processes with a view: not planned |
| `domain/host.md` | partly; 8: older-store refusal prepared for independent QA | 2, 3: live content, the ask and the host's half handing pieces to its owner: live-text. 2, 9.1: an LLM component in process handing its deltas to the owner: not planned (live-text's `later.md`). 4: a contained tree: not planned. 8: MCP host tools: not planned. 12: an isolated mode: not planned (the reliability plan's `later.md`). |
| `domain/run.md` | partly | 5.1: MCP servers as a tool source: not planned. 5.3, 15: work beside a writing child, a child from its parent's prefix: not planned (the reliability and parity plans' `later.md`). 6, 9.2: mid-work messages and threshold notes: not planned (the reliability plan's `later.md`). |
| `domain/session.md` | partly | 11: provider-native compaction: not planned (the reliability plan's `later.md`). |
| `domain/tools.md` | partly | 5: containment: not planned. |

| `protocol/agent.md` | partly | 3: the view: not planned. |
| `protocol/channel.md` | partly | 2, 7: a connected agent's credential and refusals: not planned. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8: the ask in the start and live content in pieces, with their order and best effort: live-text. 4: reasoning and a tool call's input as live content, with no producer: not planned (live-text's `later.md`) |
| `protocol/charter.md` | yes | Nothing |
| `protocol/events.md` | partly | 3.2: `containment: "trees"`: not planned. |
| `protocol/hosts.md` | partly: section 2 reads on demand, one record, live piece or end per read; section 3 reaps after the demanded end; 5.3: generated local-store records and layout admission prepared for independent QA | 3: the tree: not planned. 4: connecting later: not planned. |
| `protocol/limits.md` | partly | 2.3, 2.4, 3.6: the piece, the interval and the held bytes of live content: live-text. |
| `protocol/llm.md` | partly | 6: deltas handed over for the channel's ask: live-text. 12: edit formats per dialect: not planned. |
| `protocol/programs.md` | partly | 8: the live suite's checks of what the fake program assumes, built (`tests/end-to-end/live.rs`) and not yet run against Claude Code: not planned. |
| `protocol/transcript.md` | yes | Nothing |
| `shell.md` | partly; 4.1, 4.3, 5.3: named older-chat words, exit 1 and trace admission prepared for independent QA | 5.1: directories made at startup synced into their parents: not planned. 8: per-tree limits: not planned. 9: `isolate`: not planned (the reliability plan's `later.md`). |
| `testing.md` | partly; 2.5: real-directory Store/FileIo adapter and 6.1: separate QA profile prepared | 2.1: fault sweeps: not planned. 2.2: real-loop signals: not planned. 6: the event stream's check pairing each `running` verdict with one end (`tests/agent-process/src/events.rs` passes over `job.ended` unpaired), replay by digests, containment checks: not planned. 2.3, 4: the live suite on smith's own accounts, built (`tests/end-to-end/live.rs`, on logins under `$SMITH_LIVE`) and not yet run on them: not planned. |
| `benchmarks.md` | partly | 3.1, 5.2: each probe's and each variant's calibration in its task file (8 blocks in 4 of the 15 probe directories), with six task files and the two `history` variants to recalibrate before `suite smoke` relies on them: not planned (the parity and wall-clock plans' `later.md`). 11.1: `mid-work`, `build-environment`: not planned. 11.3: the `delegation` experiment: not planned. 15: beyond serial runs: not planned. 16.6: a change's projection on its own ratio (`summarise` multiplies in the ratios of the landed changes named to it, `benchmarks/src/parity/change.rs`): not planned. 6: Claude Code: Claude Code, and smith on Anthropic. 6, 7, 10, 11.1: each agent on the harness's own login, the `smith-claude-code` arm and the `credentials` probe on a shared sign-in record, built and not yet run on real accounts: not planned. |

## 3. Not planned

- **Directories made at startup, durably** (`shell.md`, 5.1, "State";
  skein's `shell.md`, 6, `make_root`, and `io.md`, 5): the shell makes
  the state root and each chat's directory
  (`crates/smith-local-shell/src/compose.rs:413`), and the token
  directory's parent (`credentials/sign_in.rs:228`), with std, and never
  syncs them into their parents, so a power loss can drop a chat's
  directory with the files synced beneath it. skein's io makes the token
  directory itself, and syncs it into its parent. smith's pinned skein
  has `make_root`: waits for a smith step that moves those sites onto
  it. The temporary directories of `compose/files.rs` stay: nothing
  relies on them past a crash.
- **Contained trees** (`protocol/agent.md`, sections 3 and 7; also
  `shell.md`, 8, `domain/host.md`, 4 and 9.3, `protocol/hosts.md`, 3 and
  5.5): searches, commands, checks and agents in trees with views, git
  directories read-only, write scopes, network policy, per-tree limits
  and build profiles. Waits for a skein design and plan of their own
  (skein's `io.md`, 6.2–6.4); until then, plain children with process
  groups.
- **An isolated mode** (`shell.md`, section 9; `domain/host.md`,
  section 12): the product's `isolate`, the spawned agent as a
  containment boundary. Waits for contained trees.
- **Work beside a writing child** (`domain/run.md`, section 5.3): a
  read-only parent beside one writing child, then scoped write sets,
  then asynchronous children. Waits for contained trees and a document
  of its own.
- **A child from its parent's prefix** (`domain/run.md`, section 15).
  Waits for the `parallel-children` and `budget` probes to show children
  re-orienting at a material cost.
- **Messages mid-work and threshold notes** (`domain/run.md`, sections 6
  and 9.2). Waits for nothing. The `mid-work` probe comes with it.
- **Provider-native compaction** (`domain/session.md`, section 11).
  Waits for a `compaction` experiment with a provider-native arm, which
  no plan runs yet, to favour it.
- **Edit formats per dialect** (`protocol/llm.md`, section 12). Waits
  for the `edit-format` experiment, which no plan runs yet (the
  wall-clock plan's `later.md`).
- **Codex routing extras and WebSocket** (`protocol/README.md`,
  section 9). Waits for the `affinity` experiment, which no plan runs
  yet, to show a material gain. WebSocket is on skein's roadmap.
- **MCP as a tool source** (`protocol/README.md`, sections 5 and 11;
  `domain/run.md`, section 5.1): `smith-mcp`, and through it the local
  host's first host tools. Waits for its design.
- **A connected agent** (`protocol/hosts.md`, section 4;
  `protocol/channel.md`, sections 2 and 7): a daemon a host connects to,
  with its credential and refusals. Waits for the domain's contract:
  admission, cancellation, a lost connection and the daemon's own life.
- **The testing cleanup pass** (`testing.md`, sections 2.1 and 6;
  smith-testing's `later.md`): fault sweeps asserting each fault fell;
  `tests/protocol-llm` shrunk to a protocol world; referees for
  `tests/run`, `tests/tools` and `tests/host` beyond the rules they hold;
  a focused memory test for `tests/agent`; tiny
  limits; a failed write to the agent kept apart from a malformed agent;
  the event stream's check pairing each `running` verdict with one end
  (`tests/agent-process/src/events.rs`). Waits for nothing.
- **The probes' calibrations** (`benchmarks.md`, sections 3.1 and 5.2):
  the probes and variants without a `[calibration]` block, the six task
  files the parity plan's `later.md` names for recalibration, and
  `history` and `history/small-window`, whose blocks the window's check
  (`domain/session.md`, 8.1) has outdated (the wall-clock plan's
  `later.md`), each before `suite smoke` relies on them. Waits for
  nothing but live budget.
- **Real-loop signals** (`testing.md`, section 2.2): the referee's real
  interrupt cancels a run, and a second stops its tree. Waits for
  nothing.
- **Replay by digests** (`testing.md`, section 6): skein's harness
  carries state digests, and smith's pinned skein has them (skein's
  `testing.md`, 5: `state_digest` on `Host` and `Machine`,
  `Digests::Traced`), but no smith host or fake machine gives one.
  Waits for nothing: a smith step that hashes each process's domains
  and each fake machine's state, and replays its simulated worlds with
  them.
- **Containment checks** (`testing.md`, section 6), with the
  `build-environment` probe (`benchmarks.md`, section 11.1). Wait for
  contained trees, cgroup v2 delegated to the user and unprivileged user
  namespaces.
- **The delegation experiment** (`benchmarks.md`, section 11.3): each
  agent with its sub-agents off, then both on, on `shell-cwd`. Waits for
  a plan of its own (the parity plan's `later.md`); it informs the user's open decision
  on smith's `sub_agents` default (the reliability plan's decisions.md,
  10.7).
- **Benchmarks beyond serial runs** (`benchmarks.md`, section 15):
  concurrent attempts, task kinds beyond code, a commit hook for smoke
  runs. Waits for the suites to outgrow serial runs.
- **A change's projection on its own ratio** (`benchmarks.md`, section
  16.6): `summarise` still multiplies in the ratios of the landed
  changes named to it (`benchmarks/src/parity/change.rs`). Waits for the
  next plan that measures a change against its parent; until then, a
  plan names no landed change to it.
- **The first part of LLM accounts**, the rows here and skein's that name
  it, is two plans, by layer, run after live text's skein and smith
  parts:
  - **grants:** `accounts` (section 1): the licences, skein's rows, and
    the grants and notices. Its channel is version 4, after live text's
    3, and skein's fakes it uses are those beside live text's pieces and
    holds (skein's `fake-llm.md`, 2.2 and 2.3);
  - **sources** (section 1): accounts by source, programs as backends,
    and live tests and benchmarks, built; their live runs wait (below).

  The downstream repositories' parts follow, as the second part.
- **Live runs on smith's own accounts** (`testing.md`, 2.3, 4 and 8;
  `protocol/programs.md`, 8; `benchmarks.md`, sections 6, 7, 10, 11.1
  and 15): the live suite on its logins under `$SMITH_LIVE`, with its
  checks of what the fake program assumes; `suite smoke`, each agent on
  the harness's own login, the `smith-claude-code` arm and the
  `credentials` probe. All built, none yet run on real accounts. Waits
  for the user's sign-ins on hel8, then a mission that runs them and
  fixes what they find.
- **Live content past the main conversation's text** (`protocol/channel.md`,
  section 4; `protocol/llm.md`, section 6; `domain/host.md`, sections 2
  and 9.1): reasoning and a tool call's input as they stream have
  schemas in the channel, version 3, and no producer; and no host in
  smith runs the LLM component in process, to hand its deltas to the
  owner with no channel. Not planned (live-text's `later.md`): the first
  waits for a plan that builds a second kind, the second for jig's
  live-text part, whose engine runs the agent in process.
